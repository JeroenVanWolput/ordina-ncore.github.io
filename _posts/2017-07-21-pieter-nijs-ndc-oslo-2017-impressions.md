For a couple of years, I hear colleagues talking about NDC Oslo. For most of them, NDC is one of -if not THE- best developer conferences out there. This led to the fact that, to me, this conference has this superior status.
A few years ago, I went twice to NDC London and as the hopes were high, I was a little disappointed eventually. Not that it was bad or anything, maybe my expectations were just a little bit too high. But back then, I found that the mix of topics wasn’t 100% to me..
This year, however, I finally got the opportunity to go to the mother of all (NDC) conferences: NDC Oslo. Would it transcend the London-experience? Or would it even meet my original expectations I once had about the NDC Conference?
And it all started Wednesday 14th June with Dylan Beattie’s keynote “Are there any questions”. That was one nice and easily digestible keynote! Fortunately it wasn’t too heavy because I think most of the attendees were already stuffed with the delicious breakfast that was being served! - Oooh, look, in one of my first sentences of this post about NDC I’m already talking about food… 

The rest of this *first day* was packed with lots of great sessions! Like for example “**Creating a .NET renaissance**” about how .NET community leaders should create a renaissance of the framework and technology stack that we love in order to keep it hip, cool and alive. Also, the session “**Serverless - reality or BS - notes from the trenches**” was interesting to hear about the experiences of somebody who has already built a lot of real production serverless systems instead of only the cool demo-stuff. Moreover, it was very fascinating to see how this can be done on both Azure, Amazon and Google Cloud. For many devs, when they hear ‘functional programming’, they immediately think about programming languages like F# of Scala. The session “**Functional techniques for C#**” just showed how versatile the great C# programming language truly is. Saw a lot of great concepts and patterns in this session! And then, of course, there is a session called “**C# 7**”, given by *John Skeet*… And that is actualy all you need to know to realize that this was an awesome session.

The *second day* of the conference started off with the best “**What is .NET Standard**” session I’ve ever seen: clear and simple, just like .NET standard itself! Sessions like “**Why I’m not leaving .NET**” and “**Brave New .NET**” clearly stipulated why .NET is still a very solid and alive platform that is ready for the future! 
At a development conference, not all sessions have to be technical. Like “**Optimism and the Growth Mindset**” by *Reginald Braithwaite*. He talked about *Dr. Martin Seligman's* work on *"Optimism"* and how this changed his life. A fantastic and inspirational talk! 

On the *last day* of the conference, I only had time for 2 sessions (stupid flight schedules!) but these were 2 nice sessions to close the NDC conference for me: “**Building Connected & Disconnected Mobile Apps**” by *James Montemagno* and “**Beyond step-by step debugging in Visual Studio**” by *Tess Ferrandez*. I was amazed by how fluently she was using WinDbg to find the culprit of a crash in an application. She made WinDbg look easy to use…. Both of these sessions were great, given by two awesome speakers. I had the chance to talk to both James and Tess during the conference, really nice people! 

And besides all these sessions, there was of course the party at Thursday night. The band “*Love Shack*” rocked the Oslo Spektrum with songs from the 80’s, including Brian Adams, Metallica, Depeche Mode, … Fan-tas-tic!
And did I mention anything about the food at NDC? Yes, I did actually already in one of the first sentences… But still I want to point out that the food was marvelous! From the early morning until the last sessions, there was food being served constantly! 

So did NDC Oslo live up to the expectations? Yes! Yes, it did! What a great conference! Well organized, good sessions, good mix of topics, great speakers, awesome food, the ‘overflow room’ where you can go to if you can’t choose between multiple sessions (all sessions are streamed live on a large screen and you get an audio device on which you can choose from what session you want the audio),… I truly hope I can go back to NDC next year! (I know you are reading this, Jörgen*)
*Jörgen: my manager… ;-)

By the way, all the session (or at leat most of them) can be [viewed online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuac__g928E&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGewi0lbnahxEpisoP5WZocX). Those that I pointed out in this post are really worthwhile to watch!
